About var keyword

1-
'var' is keyword used for aliasing for a class name
so for creating an object
 
var obj= new PersonDeatils();
basically we use 'var' keyword when the class name is very lengthy .so to do fast coding we use  'var' in place class name
In class name we can use 'var' keyword at the left side only 

2-
2nd use of 'var' keyword 
we can not declare the 'var' at the class scope

3-
we can declare the 'var' at any function or methods

4-
you can not use 'var' in the parameter of any function 

5- 
once we have declare  the type  of 'var'.then we can not change the type of 'var'

eg-
var name="manoj";
name=12;  //here it will show an error because we have decleared the var is of type string and now we declearing it as an int
 

var name="Manoj Singh Negi";

so here 'var' will convert into string becoz at the right side a string is initialized
so 'var' can also used for aliasing for datatype .

dynamic is just opposite of var.
