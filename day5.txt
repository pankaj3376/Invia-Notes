1-Indexer is a array of properties
In Indexer-
first remove all the private varible and declare a private arr type  varieble

indexer is refer by this keyword

with the help of indexer also we are setting and getting the data in private varible
but the only difference is that in indexer we declaring only a single array varible
of type object so that it can store all the values like int,char,string etc.

class Person{
   object []mydata=new object[3];
   public object this[int i]
   {
     get{return mydata[i];}
     set{mydata[i]=value;}
    }
}

class Main{
   Person obj=new Person();  //here obj=this 

    obj[0]="Mannu Negi";
    obj[1]=1;
    obj[2]="MCA";

    Console.WriteLine(obj[0]+" "+obj[1]+" "+obj[2]);

}

Note - actually i want make such an application in which ,I dont want to expose 
the  internal mechanism .but we can access those things by some operational things
thats called  encapsulation.
